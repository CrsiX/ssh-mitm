# This script is the AppRun entry point used by an AppImage to set up the necessary environment
# and directory path for the application. It first ensures that the APPDIR variable is defined,
# representing the root of the AppImage filesystem. After setting up the environment, it delegates
# control to the `startapp.py` script, which is responsible for initiating the main Python
# application. This setup allows for a layered initialization process, ensuring that the
# application is launched with the correct context and dependencies within the AppImage's sandbox.

# Check if APPDIR is already set, if not, determine and set it to the AppImage's mount directory.
# APPDIR needs to be set as it specifies the directory where the AppImage content is located.
